# PROJECT OUTLINE
Setting up an experimental information retrieval pipeline for the purpose of comparing previously used IR methods with newly learned approaches such as graph-based approaches or neural re-rankings.

## Related Work & Resources
- pyterrier: IR set up
- TREC-Covid Collection: cord19 data set
- gephi: graph exploration
- scholarly: source of metadata and citation 
- publishorperish: source of bibliometrics
- huggingface: Trained BERT models

## Approach
Compare key IR metrics between baseline IR methods such as:  
- TF-IDF
- BM25  
With additional approaches such as
- Graphbased bibliometrics (citation, co-citation, references)
- Neural re-rankings with recent Tansformers such as BERT
This is done in order to inspect how and whether these approaches can improve IR effectiveness within the scope of the TREC-COVID collection.
